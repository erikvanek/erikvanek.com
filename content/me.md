I like to do stuff. Grow greens [for example](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

## Who am I?

That's a good one. Glad you ask. Trying to find out lately. At least 20 years.

Overgrown brat? Hopefully not.

Professionally software developer for several years. Wannabe designer, hobby cook. Sometimes hater (constructive preferably!). Loyal person (you need to earn this loyalty though). I love my family, friends, sports and good sleep. Food indeed.

### What do I appreciate?
- honesty
- mediterranean food (peposo!)
- getting to the core of the problem
- useful tools
- pragmatic mindset
- challenging status quo
- decisiveness
- creative wordplay :)

### What I do not like?
- bullshit
- wasteful tools (e.g. dull knives)
- stereotype
- meal vouchers
- "But we've always done this way" mindset
- overcooked pasta
