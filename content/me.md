I like to do stuff. Grow greens [for example](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

That's a good one. Glad you ask. Trying to find out lately. At least 20 years.

Overgrown brat? Hopefully not.

Professionally software developer for several years. Wannabe designer, hobby cook. Sometimes constructive hater. Loyal person. You need to earn this loyalty though. I love my family, friends, sports and good sleep. Food indeed.
