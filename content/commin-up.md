Random parts of my life not fitting anywhere else but still worth mentioning.

## School times

Before being competent to work in software industry, I've graduated from Computer graphics and digital image processing at [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), Masaryk University in Brno. It went well, especially that part with [playing with Kinect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvkEJLpcq8&t=44s). It's been a while though :)

For my masters, I decided to attend Information studies with emphasis on service design at [KISK](http://kisk.phil.muni.cz/en). Maaan what a change. During that time, I had a chance to attend Erasmus exchange in Oslo that was quite demanding, but inspirational at the same time.



## "Přístupnější stát"

It started as a school project - but lasted almost three years. Given the fact that Czech e-government portals are usually hard to use, we wanted to promote some change. With couple of schoolmates, we have formed a project called ["Přístupnější stát"](https://www.facebook.com/pristupnejsi.stat/) (can be translated to English as something like 'More accessible state'). Our mission was to help cities to make their websites more usable to their users. We have conducted several usability testing sessions for different cities. City representatives were later given an analysis of how their website succeeded (or not) while facing city inhabitants trying to perform routine tasks on the site. We have also taken part in yearly website contest among cities.
