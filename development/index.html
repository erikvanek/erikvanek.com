<p>What is my favourite platform you may ask? <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open web</a> I reply.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-happenning-recently">What&rsquo;s happenning recently?</h2>

<p>Professionally I&rsquo;ve spent last five years or so working as a software developer for several companies. To name a few - <a href="https://www.fnz.com/">FNZ</a>, <a href="https://www.adacta-group.com/">Adacta</a> or most recently <a href="https://www.snapshot.travel/">Snapshot</a> where I also tried to implement some basic user-centered design methods. That was quite fun and eye opening. I&rsquo;d like to do these more!</p>

<p>During those years spent as a software developer, I&rsquo;ve had a chance to get in touch with some incredibly skilled and nice people. I also had a chance to get my hands on technologies, that I consider important these days in software development, to name a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript - web&rsquo;s lingua franca these days. Hard to get stuff done without javascript. Recent ESx flavors make it more and more versatile and accessible tool in your toolbox. Slightly suffering from backwards compatibility though :(

<ul>
<li>React - React is awesome, right? Yes, Vue is steadily growing, Angular has a huge community, but counting its pros and cons, I believe React still wins in frontend world. Feel free to prove me wrong :)</li>
<li>Redux - Apps without state are not apps. Its heavy inspiration in Elm made made me interested in Elm lately. Other than that, Dan Abramov has made a great yet simple to understand tool for React ecosystem. Kudos for that!</li>
<li>Typescript - type safety is nice. Typescript can help you prevent dumb errors, but also slow you down. Depends on pragmatically defined rules. At first I was not a big fan, recently we have a good relationship.</li>
<li>other tools like Webpack, Reselect, Storybook, Jest for testing, postcss, npm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>.NET land - in all companies I&rsquo;ve worked so far, backend was written in .NET. Last two years I&rsquo;ve spent working with .NET Core. I am at writing SOLID backend code, trying to keep minimum of logic in controllers when using MVC. If I could choose between frontend or backend, I&rsquo;m all for frontend work though.</li>
<li>Responsive webdesign - feels like proper mindset to me when building <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/this-is-the-web/">web these days</a>. <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/there_is_no_breakpoint"><strong>SOMEHOW MENTION THERE IS NO BREAKPOINT</strong></a></li>
<li>Progressive web apps - again more of a mindset of having user at first place. Strong emphasis on user experience is aligned with my core values in software development. Helping users to get their content offline is still important, especially when we&rsquo;re relying on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/poor-connectivity/#what_is_lie-fi">lie-fi</a>.</li>
<li>Elm - I&rsquo;ve been digging into it lately. Having no null value is so comfortable. Also twisting your head into functional paradigm is an interesting endeavour.</li>
<li>Sass, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
