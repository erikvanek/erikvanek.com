<p>What is my favourite platform you may ask? <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open web</a> I reply.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-up-to">What am I up to?</h2>

<p>Professionally I&rsquo;ve spent last five years or so working as a software developer for several companies. To name a few - <a href="https://www.fnz.com/">FNZ</a>, <a href="https://www.adacta-group.com/">Adacta</a> or most recently <a href="https://www.snapshot.travel/">Snapshot</a> where I also tried to implement some basic user-centered design methods. That was quite fun and eye opening. I&rsquo;d like to do this more!</p>

<p>During those years spent as a software developer, I had a chance to get in touch with some incredibly skilled and open-minded people. It was also excellent opportunity to get my hands on useful technologies in web development space. To name a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript - web&rsquo;s lingua franca these days. Hard to get stuff done without javascript. Recent ESx flavors make it more and more versatile and accessible tool in your toolbox. Slightly suffering from backwards compatibility though :(

<ul>
<li>React - React is awesome, right? Yes, Vue is steadily growing, Angular has a huge community, but counting its pros and cons, I believe React still wins in frontend world. Feel free to prove me wrong.</li>
<li>Redux - It is hard to build apps without them having state. React&rsquo;s heavy inspiration in Elm made made me interested in Elm lately. Other than that, Dan Abramov has made a great yet simple to understand tool for React ecosystem. Kudos for that!</li>
<li>Typescript - Type safety is nice. Typescript can help you prevent dumb errors, but also slow you down. Depends on optimally defined rules. At first I was not a big fan, recently we have a good relationship.</li>
<li>Also got in touch with other tools like Webpack, Reselect, Storybook, Jest for testing, postcss, npm and some others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>.NET land - in all companies I&rsquo;ve worked so far, backend was written in .NET. Last two years I&rsquo;ve spent working with .NET Core. I aim at writing SOLID backend code, trying to keep minimum of logic in controllers when using MVC. If I could choose between frontend or backend, I&rsquo;m all for frontend work though.</li>
<li>Responsive webdesign - feels like a proper mindset when building <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/this-is-the-web/">web these days</a>. It is crucial to deliver inclusive designs in the world of growing <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/there_is_no_breakpoint">device fragmentation</a>.</li>
<li>Progressive web apps - Again more of a mindset focusing on app interactiveness and responsiveness. Every second wasted rendering, data fetching or parsing app content is wasted time for users. Strong emphasis put on users&rsquo;s experience is aligned with my core values in software development. Progressive web apps help delivering content even when users are suffering from <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/poor-connectivity/#what_is_lie-fi">lie-fi</a> or do not have any connection at all. I see it as a way of progressive enhancement to a standard online/offline duality.</li>
<li>Elm - I&rsquo;ve been digging into it lately. Having no <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">null</a> value is so comfortable. Also twisting your head into functional paradigm is an interesting endeavour. Elm architecture (variation of model-view-update) seems like an evolution of well known MVC pattern. Smart Elm compiler is also really helpful tool with great developer experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-about-the-process">How about the process?</h2>

<p>Is waterfall dead? Is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">agile dead</a>? I hope not. Both have their place and both can be successful. Hopefully we can take the good out of each methodology and use it in our advantage.</p>

<p>Generally speaking - cross-department collaborations in combination with self-motivated individuals seem to make a difference when building well suited products. Why is that so? Diverse feedback that you get from people with different backgrounds is crucial when iterating on some concept. It might take time, but if your aim is to build superior products, it&rsquo;s inevitable. If you don&rsquo;t care about the quality, save your time and just do things how <em>you</em> think they should be done. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get lucky and will hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>Internal motivation of team members helps aligning their internal expectations towards common (hopefully internalized) goal. External motivatin works too but to a limited extent.</p>

<p>I did mention iterating previously. That&rsquo;s because it is the important part of incremental way of doing things. Fast (not rushed) prototyping helps find the right way to do things. Learning to throw away is important skill to learn in order to succeed. Ideally including end users into prototyping of different <em>concepts or whatever</em>.</p>

<p>cross-department collabs
short feedback loop
including users in whole lifecycle
automation + continous delivery
deep work</p>
